This software aims to easily embed maps managed by Leaflet on your project.\n\n### [tombatossals/angular-leaflet-directive](http://github.com/tombatossals/angular-leaflet-directive)\nThis is a personal project, which has been coded by me helped by many people for some years. I continue evolving it frequently, but if you need enterprise support of it, sorry, I can't give you more support that my spare time allows me.

In the meantime, take a look at this URL for some minimal descriptions: https://tombatossals.github.com/angular-leaflet-directive\n\n## Getting started/How to use it\n\nInclude the `leaflet-directive` dependency on your Angular module:\n```\nvar app = angular.module('demoapp', ['leaflet-directive']);\n```\n\nAfter that, you are ready to rock. Just define some objects with the basic configuration you want reflected in your map and the rendered map will obey you. Also, you can modify that configuration dinamically if you need to. Let's see an example.\n\n### center\n\nIf you want to set the map view to a precise position, you can define\nthe \"center\" property of the scope (lat, lng, zoom). It will also be updated\ninteracting on the scope and on the leaflet map in two-way binding. Example:\n\n```javascript\nangular.extend($scope, {\n    center: {\n        lat: 51.505,\n        lng: -0.09,\n        zoom: 8\n    }\n});\n```\n\nFinally, you must include the markup directive on your HTML page. One important thing is that you must define the map width&height, as attributes of the directive or with CSS code, as you wish.\n```html\n<leaflet lf-center=\"center\" height=\"480px\" width=\"640px\"></leaflet>\n```\n\nIf you want to have more than one map on the page and access their respective map objects, add an *id* attribute to your leaflet directive in HTML:\n\n```html\n<leaflet id=\"mymap\" lf-center=\"center\" height=\"480px\" width=\"640px\"></leaflet>\n```\n",
